Dear Nature Editorial Board,

Please find attached the manuscript "Darwin's Dream: Foundations of ecological and evolutionary change", which I hope you will consider for publication as an article in Nature.

The most important and enduring advances in scientific theory reveal broad and universal principles about the natural world. These theoretical advances can often be expressed in simple, elegant equations that serve as a foundation for further scientific enquiry. Examples include Newton's second law of motion, Maxwell's equations, the Schr√∂dinger equation, and the Price equation. The Price equation is the fundamental equation that completely describes evolutionary change in any evolving system. Its discovery by George Price was first published in Nature in 1970.

Historically, evolutionary theory has been developed largely separate from ecological theory, despite widespread recognition of the inseparability of ecological and evolutionary phenomena stretching all the way back to Darwin. Recent efforts have been made to synthesise eco-evolutionary theory through modelling, but a true foundation of eco-evolutoinary change has been missing. Here we fill this gap with a fundamental equation of eco-evolutionary change, which defines change for any possible evolving population and from which the fundamental equations of both ecology and evolution can be derived.

We expect that our unifying equation will serve as a starting point for a richer synthesis of ecology and evolutionary biology, including a synthesis between social evolution and density-dependent population change. It also demonstrates fundamental links between eco-evolutionary change and ecosystem function, and derives the relationship between population growth and evolutionary fitness from first principles.
