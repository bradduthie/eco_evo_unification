abstract = {Ecologists have identified a growing number of functional traits that promote invasion. However, whether trait differences between exotic and native species promote invasion success by enhancing niche differences or giving invaders competitive advantages is poorly understood. We explored the mechanisms by which phenology determines invasion success in a California annual plant community by quantifying how the seasonal timing of growth relates to niche differences that stabilize coexistence, and the competitive ability differences that drive dominance and exclusion. We parameterized models of community dynamics from experimentally assembled annual communities in which exotic plants displayed earlier, coincident, or later phenology than native residents. Using recent theoretical advances from the coexistence literature, we found that differences in phenology promote stabilizing niche differences between exotic and native species. However, phenology was more strongly related to competitive ability differences, allowing later invaders to outcompete earlier native competitors and native residents to outcompete earlier invaders in field experiments. Few of these insights could be inferred by comparing the competitive outcomes across invaders, highlighting the need to quantify niche and competitive ability differences when disentangling how species differences drive invasion success.},

abstract = {The Price equation partitions total evolutionary change into two components. The first component provides an abstract expression of natural selection. The second component subsumes all other evolutionary processes, including changes during transmission. The natural selection component is often used in applications. Those applications attract widespread interest for their simplicity of expression and ease of interpretation. Those same applications attract widespread criticism by dropping the second component of evolutionary change and by leaving unspecified the detailed assumptions needed for a complete study of dynamics. Controversies over approximation and dynamics have nothing to do with the Price equation itself, which is simply a mathematical equivalence relation for total evolutionary change expressed in an alternative form. Disagreements about approach have to do with the tension between the relative valuation of abstract versus concrete analyses. The Price equation's greatest value has been on the abstract side, particularly the invariance relations that illuminate the understanding of natural selection. Those abstract insights lay the foundation for applications in terms of kin selection, information theory interpretations of natural selection and partitions of causes by path analysis.

abstract = {I develop a framework for interpreting the forces that act on any population described by frequencies. The conservation of total frequency, or total probability, shapes the characteristics of force. I begin with Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. That theorem partitions the total evolutionary change of a population into two components. The first component is the partial change caused by the direct force of natural selection, holding constant all aspects of the environment. The second component is the partial change caused by the changing environment. I demonstrate that Fisher's partition of total change into the direct force of selection and the forces from the changing environmental frame of reference is identical to d'Alembert's principle of mechanics, which separates the work done by the direct forces from the work done by the inertial forces associated with the changing frame of reference. In d'Alembert's principle, there exist inertial forces from a change in the frame of reference that exactly balance the direct forces. I show that the conservation of total probability strongly shapes the form of the balance between the direct and inertial forces. I then use the strong results for conserved probability to obtain general results for the change in any system quantity, such as biological fitness or energy. Those general results derive from simple coordinate changes between frequencies and system quantities. Ultimately, d'Alembert's separation of direct and inertial forces provides deep conceptual insight into the interpretation of forces and the unification of disparate fields of study.},

A major challenge of this theoretical work has been to un-ravel the tangled feedback loop between ecology and evolution. This has prompted the development of two main classes of models. While quantitative genetics models jointly consider the ecological and evo-lutionary dynamics of a focal population, a separation of timescales between ecology and evolution is assumed by evolutionary game the-ory, adaptive dynamics, and inclusive fitness theory. As a result, the-oretical evolutionary ecology tends to be divided among different schools of thought, with different toolboxes and motivations. My aim in this synthesis is to highlight the connections between these different approaches and clarify the current state of theory in evo-lutionary ecology. Central to this approach is to make explicit the dependence on environmental dynamics of the population and evo-lutionary dynamics, thereby materializing the eco-evolutionary feed-back loop. This perspective sheds light on the interplay between environmental feedback and the timescales of ecological and evolu-tionary processes. I conclude by discussing some potential exten-sions and challenges to our current theoretical understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {A fundamental challenge in ecology continues to be identifying mechanisms that stabilize community dynamics. In recent years, there has been growing empirical evidence highlighting that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can dramatically impact community-level properties, including stability. Moreover, there is evidence that evolution happens at rates ranging from slower than to commensurate to ecological rates, and this affects the impact of feedbacks. Theoretical work to mechanistically understand how eco-evolutionary feedbacks impact stability has focused on specific ecological modules with just one or two evolving species. Here, we provide a general framework for determining the effects of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on stability in communities with an arbitrary number of interacting species and evolving traits for when evolution is slow and fast. We characterize how these feedbacks lead to stable communities that would be unstable in the absence of the feedbacks, and vice versa. In addition, we show how this characterization provides a partitioning of the roles of direct and indirect feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes on community stability, and how this partitioning depends on the rate of evolution relative to ecology. Applying our methods to models of competing species and food chains, we demonstrate how the functional form of trade-offs, genetic correlations between traits, and the rate of evolution determine whether eco-evolutionary feedbacks stabilize or destabilize community dynamics.},

abstract = {Theoretical models pertaining to feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes are prevalent in multiple biological fields. An integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the fields and the use of different methodological approaches. Here, we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including populations, communities and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks across spatial scales. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and evolutionary time scales. We show the importance of density- and frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial context.

@article{Rice2009,
abstract = {Background: Migration between local populations plays an important role in evolution - influencing local adaptation, speciation, extinction, and the maintenance of genetic variation. Like other evolutionary mechanisms, migration is a stochastic process, involving both random and deterministic elements. Many models of evolution have incorporated migration, but these have all been based on simplifying assumptions, such as low migration rate, weak selection, or large population size. We thus have no truly general and exact mathematical description of evolution that incorporates migration. Methodology/Principal Findings: We derive an exact equation for directional evolution, essentially a stochastic Price equation with migration, that encompasses all processes, both deterministic and stochastic, contributing to directional change in an open population. Using this result, we show that increasing the variance in migration rates reduces the impact of migration relative to selection. This means that models that treat migration as a single parameter tend to be biassed - overestimating the relative impact of immigration. We further show that selection and migration interact in complex ways, one result being that a strategy for which fitness is negatively correlated with migration rates (high fitness when migration is low) will tend to increase in frequency, even if it has lower mean fitness than do other strategies. Finally, we derive an equation for the effective migration rate, which allows some of the complex stochastic processes that we identify to be incorporated into models with a single migration parameter. Conclusions/Significance: As has previously been shown with selection, the role of migration in evolution is determined by the entire distributions of immigration and emigration rates, not just by the mean values. The interactions of stochastic migration with stochastic selection produce evolutionary processes that are invisible to deterministic evolutionary theory. {\textcopyright} 2009 Rice, Papadopoulos.},

abstract = {In natural populations, individuals of a given genotype may belong to different classes. Such classes can represent different age groups, developmental stages, or habitats. Class structure has important evolutionary consequences because the fitness of individuals with the same genetic background may vary depending on their class. As a result, demographic transitions between classes can cause fluctuations in the trait mean that need to be removed when estimating selection on a trait. Intrinsic differences between classes are classically taken into account byweighting individuals by class-specific reproductive values, defined as the relative contribution of individuals in a given class to the future of the population. These reproductive values are generally constant weights calculated from a constant projection matrix. Here, I show for large populations and clonal reproduction that reproductive values can be defined as time-dependent weights satisfying dynamical demographic equations that depend only on the average between-class transition rates over all genotypes. Using these time-dependent demographic reproductive values yields a simple Price equation where the nonselective effects of between-class transitions are removed from the dynamics of the trait. This generalizes previous theory to a large class of ecological scenarios, taking into account density dependence, ecological feedbacks, arbitrary strength of selection, and arbitrary trait distributions. I discuss the role of reproductive values for prospective and retrospective analyses of the dynamics of phenotypic traits.},

abstract = {The Price equation describes the change in populations. Change concerns some value, such as biological fitness, information or physical work. The Price equation reveals universal aspects for the nature of change, independently of the meaning ascribed to values. By understanding those universal aspects, we can see more clearly why fundamental mathematical results in different disciplines often share a common form. We can also interpret more clearly the meaning of key results within each discipline. For example, the mathematics of natural selection in biology has a form closely related to information theory and physical entropy. Does that mean that natural selection is about information or entropy? Or do natural selection, information and entropy arise as interpretations of a common underlying abstraction? The Price equation suggests the latter. The Price equation achieves its abstract generality by partitioning change into two terms. The first term naturally associates with the direct forces that cause change. The second term naturally associates with the changing frame of reference. In the Price equation's canonical form, total change remains zero because the conservation of total probability requires that all probabilities invariantly sum to one. Much of the shared common form for the mathematics of different disciplines may arise from that seemingly trivial invariance of total probability, which leads to the partitioning of total change into equal and opposite components of the direct forces and the changing frame of reference.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Fifty years of the Price equation'.},

abstract = {The Price equation shows the unity between the fundamental expressions of change in biology, in information and entropy descriptions of populations, and in aspects of thermodynamics. The Price equation partitions the change in the average value of a metric between two populations. A population may be composed of organisms or particles or any members of a set to which we can assign probabilities. A metric may be biological fitness or physical energy or the output of an arbitrarily complicated function that assigns quantitative values to members of the population. The first part of the Price equation describes how directly applied forces change the probabilities assigned to members of the population when holding constant the metrical values of the members---a fixed metrical frame of reference. The second part describes how the metrical values change, altering the metrical frame of reference. In canonical examples, the direct forces balance the changing metrical frame of reference, leaving the average or total metrical values unchanged. In biology, relative reproductive success (fitness) remains invariant as a simple consequence of the conservation of total probability. In physics, systems often conserve total energy. Nonconservative metrics can be described by starting with conserved metrics, and then studying how coordinate transformations between conserved and nonconserved metrics alter the geometry of the dynamics and the aggregate values of populations. From this abstract perspective, key results from different subjects appear more simply as universal geometric principles for the dynamics of populations subject to the constraints of particular conserved quantities},

abstract = {George Price (19221975; Figure 1) was an American scientist whose brief but productive career as an evolutionary theorist during the late 1960s and early 1970s is one of the most fascinating episodes in the history of the discipline. Price trained as a chemist and had worked on the Manhattan Project before becoming a science writer. Self-funded by a large insurance settlement after a botched medical operation, he relocated to London at the end of 1967 and began teaching himself the basics of evolutionary theory, working first in libraries and then at the Galton Laboratory at University College London. Bringing a fresh perspective to the discipline, Price discovered an entirely novel approach to population genetics, and the basis for a general theory of selection the Price equation. Other accomplishments followed, but the period of discovery was cut tragically short by Prices suicide, after which his name faded into obscurity. However, the Price equation has come to underpin several key areas of evolutionary theory, and is beginning to illuminate difficult issues in other disciplines.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen major advances in our understanding of the way in which cultural transmission takes place and the factors that affect it. The theoretical foundations of those advances have been built by postulating the existence of a variety of different processes and deriving their consequences mathematically or by simulation. The operation of these processes in the real world can be studied through experiment and naturalistic observation. In contrast, archaeologists have an 'inverse problem'. For them the object of study is the residues of different behaviours represented by the archaeological record and the problem is to infer the microscale processes that produced them, a vital task for cultural evolution since this is the only direct record of past cultural patterns. The situation is analogous to that faced by population geneticists scanning large number of genes and looking for evidence of selection as opposed to drift, but more complicated for many reasons, not least the enormous variety of different forces that affect cultural transmission. This paper reviews the progress that has been made in inferring processes from patterns and the role of demography in those processes, together with the problems that have arisen.},

We demonstrate how these responses, which potentially occur over different timescales and are usually studied in isolation, can be combined in an additive way; and we discuss the main advantages of doing this. We illustrate our approach using two worked examples, concerning the emergence of toxin resistance within microbial communities, and the estimation of carbon uptake by marine phytoplankton in high-CO2 environments. We find that this approach allows us to exclude particular mechanistic hypotheses with regard to community-level transformations, and to identify specific instances where appropriate data are lacking. Thus Price's equation provides not only a powerful conceptual aid, but also a means for testing hypotheses and for directing empirical research programmes.},

abstract = {I develop a framework for interpreting the forces that act on any population described by frequencies. The conservation of total frequency, or total probability, shapes the characteristics of force. I begin with Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. That theorem partitions the total evolutionary change of a population into two components. The first component is the partial change caused by the direct force of natural selection, holding constant all aspects of the environment. The second component is the partial change caused by the changing environment. I demonstrate that Fisher's partition of total change into the direct force of selection and the forces from the changing environmental frame of reference is identical to d'Alembert's principle of mechanics, which separates the work done by the direct forces from the work done by the inertial forces associated with the changing frame of reference. In d'Alembert's principle, there exist inertial forces from a change in the frame of reference that exactly balance the direct forces. I show that the conservation of total probability strongly shapes the form of the balance between the direct and inertial forces. I then use the strong results for conserved probability to obtain general results for the change in any system quantity, such as biological fitness or energy. Those general results derive from simple coordinate changes between frequencies and system quantities. Ultimately, d'Alembert's separation of direct and inertial forces provides deep conceptual insight into the interpretation of forces and the unification of disparate fields of study.},

Particular scaling relations transform the canonical exponential and Gaussian patterns into the variety of commonly observed patterns. The scaling relations themselves arise from the fundamental invariances of shift, stretch and rotation, plus a few additional invariances. Prior work described the three fundamental invariances as a consequence of the equilibrium canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics or the Jaynesian maximization of information entropy. By contrast, I emphasize the primacy and sufficiency of invariance alone to explain the commonly observed patterns. Primary invariance naturally creates the array of commonly observed scaling relations and associated probability patterns, whereas the classical approaches derived from statistical mechanics or information theory require special assumptions to derive commonly observed scales.},

abstract = {The style -function dichotomy lies at the heart of the evolutionary archaeology research program. It also is the source of much disagreement about how we should conceive of the processes of culture change. Evolutionary archaeologists tend to view archaeological attributes as either functional, if they respond to selection, or stylistic, if they do not. Others tend to see style and function as operating simultaneously. A resolution to this problem is proposed through development of a for- mal mathematical model of style- and function-based evolution using a hypothetical example of temporal patterns of ceramic decoration within a community of household-based potters. Simple replicator equations are proposed to describe the household- scale dynamics of change in the relative frequency of ceramic decoration. These low-level dynamics can be dis- tinguished on the basis of whether or not change is correlated with some measure of performance, utility, or payoff. The replicator equations are then used to derive several versions of the Price Equation (Price 1970), a very general and pow- erful statement about total evolutionary change in any system. At this scale of analysis, total change is similarly partitioned into payoff-correlated (functional) and payoff-independent (stylistic) contributions and it is shown that these processes are likely to operate simultaneously. Tests of the model against simulated data show that it is possible to estimate with consid- erable accuracy the strength of functional and stylistic contributions to culture change under ideal conditions of site preser- vation. Further theoretical work is needed, however, to understand how diverse site formation and disturbance processes might impact application of the model in real archaeological settings.},

abstract = {Though the Price equation in itself is simply a statistical identity, biologists have often adopted a ‘causal interpretation' of the equation, in the sense that its component terms have been supposed to correspond to distinct causal processes in evolution, such as natural selection and transmission bias. In this paper, we bring the issue of causal interpretation to the fore, by studying the conditions under which it is legitimate to read causal meaning into the Price equation. We argue that only if substantive assumptions about causal structure are made, which can be represented in the form of a causal model, can the component terms of the Price equation be interpreted as causally meaningful. We conclude with a reflection on the epistemic uses of the Price equation, emphasizing the difference between the description, explanation and prediction of evolutionary change.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Fifty years of the Price equation'.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory has made large impacts on our understanding and management of the world, in part because it has been able to incorporate new data and new insights successfully. Nonetheless, there is currently a tension between certain biological phenomena and mainstream evolutionary theory. For example, how does the inheritance of molecular epigenetic changes fit into mainstream evolutionary theory? Is niche construction an evolutionary process? Is local adaptation via habitat choice also adaptive evolution? These examples suggest there is scope (and perhaps even a need) to broaden our views on evolution. We identify three aspects whose incorporation into a single framework would enable a more generalised approach to the understanding and study of adaptive evolution: (i) a broadened view of extended phenotypes; (ii) that traits can respond to each other; and (iii) that inheritance can be non-genetic. We use causal modelling to integrate these three aspects with established views on the variables and mechanisms that drive and allow for adaptive evolution. Our causal model identifies natural selection and non-genetic inheritance of adaptive parental responses as two complementary yet distinct and independent drivers of adaptive evolution. Both drivers are compatible with the Price equation; specifically, non-genetic inheritance of parental responses is captured by an often-neglected component of the Price equation. Our causal model is general and simplified, but can be adjusted flexibly in terms of variables and causal connections, depending on the research question and/or biological system. By revisiting the three examples given above, we show how to use it as a heuristic tool to clarify conceptual issues and to help design empirical research. In contrast to a gene-centric view defining evolution only in terms of genetic change, our generalised approach allows us to see evolution as a change in the whole causal structure, consisting not just of genetic but also of phenotypic and environmental variables.},

abstract = {It is often suggested that any group selection model can be recast in terms of inclusive fitness. A standard reference to support that claim is "'Quantitative genetics, inclusive fitness, and group selection" by Queller (1992) in the American Naturalist 139 (3), 540-558. In that paper the Price equation is used for the derivation of this claim. Instead of a general derivation, we try out a simple model. For this simple example, we find that the result does not hold. The non-equivalence of group selection and kin selection is therefore not only an important finding in itself, but also a case where the use of the Price equation leads to a claim that is not correct. If results that are arrived at with the Price equation are not correct, they can typically be repaired by adding extra assumptions, or explicitly stating implicit ones. We give examples with relatively mild and with less mild extra assumptions. We also discuss why the Price equation is often referred to as dynamically insufficient, and we try to find out what Price's theorem could be.},

@article{VanVeelen2005,
abstract = {This paper distinguishes two categories of questions that the Price equation can help us answer. The two different types of questions require two different disciplines that are related, but nonetheless move in opposite directions. These disciplines are probability theory on the one hand and statistical inference on the other. In the literature on the Price equation this distinction is not made. As a result of this, questions that require a probability model are regularly approached with statistical tools. In this paper, we examine the possibilities of the Price equation for answering questions of either type. By spending extra attention on mathematical formalities, we avoid the two disciplines to get mixed up. After that, we look at some examples, both from kin selection and from group selection, that show how the inappropriate use of statistical terminology can put us on the wrong track. Statements that are 'derived' with the help of the Price equation are, therefore, in many cases not the answers they seem to be. Going through the derivations in reverse can, however, be helpful as a guide how to build proper (probabilistic) models that do give answers. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Price equation shows that evolutionary change can be written in terms of two fundamental variables: The fitness of parents (or ancestors) and the phenotypes of their offspring (descendants). Its power lies in the fact that it requires no simplifying assumptions other than a closed population, but realizing the full potential of Price's result requires that we flesh out the mathematical representation of both fitness and offspring phenotype. Specifically, both need to be treated as stochastic variables that are themselves functions of parental phenotype. Here, I show how new mathematical tools allow us to do this without introducing any simplifying assumptions. Combining this representation of fitness and phenotype with the stochastic Price equation reveals fundamental rules underlying multivariate evolution and the evolution of inheritance. Finally, I show how the change in the entire phenotype distribution of a population, not simply the mean phenotype, can be written as a single compact equation from which the Price equation and related results can be derived as special cases.

abstract = {Aim: Recent works on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships highlight abundance fluctuations of common species as more important for delivering ecosystem services than changes in species richness and composition in real-world ecosystems. However, evidence on BEF relationships in natural ecosystems is still limited, especially for large vertebrates. Here, we aimed to disentangle the relative roles of species richness, composition and abundance of vertebrate scavenger communities in the ecological process of carcass elimination, a pivotal ecosystem service, in natural ecosystems. We evaluated the variability in the scavenging function across ecosystems, and examined the factors explaining it. Location: Nine natural ecosystems, seven in Europe and two in Africa. Major taxa studied: Vertebrates. Time period: 2006–2013. Methods: We obtained BEF relationships from vertebrate scavengers consuming ungulate carcasses monitored through motion-triggered remote cameras. We used the Price equation to tease out the relative roles of species richness, composition and abundance in the scavenging efficiency of vertebrates. Results: We recorded 46 vertebrate scavenging species, 30 in Spain and 16 in South Africa. Two main patterns drove BEF relationships. Species richness and composition drove carcass consumption in ecosystems where functionally dominant scavengers were rare, whilst context dependent effects (including species abundance) did so where functionally dominant species were common. Contrastingly to previous studies, abundance fluctuations in vertebrate scavengers were not exclusively related to common species but to the specialization of obligate scavengers (i.e., Gyps vultures) to rapidly gather at carcasses and to the top-down control exerted by large predators. Main conclusions: Rare and threatened species such as vultures and top predators become functionally key species in scavenging processes, highlighting that the delivery of ecosystem services still stands as a general argument for biodiversity conservation in vertebrate communities. Human persecution of vultures and top predators worldwide is expected to alter ecosystem functioning and services such as nutrient recycling or disease control.},

I argue that evolutionary biology has never seen a paradigm shift, in the philosophical sense of the term, except when it moved from natural theology to empirical science in the middle of the 19th century. The Extended Synthesis, accordingly, is an expansion of the Modern Synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s, and one that - like its predecessor - will probably take decades to complete. {\textcopyright} 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.},

 abstract = {The seemingly innocent observation that the activities of
organisms bring about changes in environments is so obvious that it
seems an unlikely focus for a new line of thinking about evolution.
Yet niche construction--as this process of organism-driven
environmental modification is known--has hidden complexities. By
transforming biotic and abiotic sources of natural selection in
external environments, niche construction generates feedback in
evolution on a scale hitherto underestimated--and in a manner that
transforms the evolutionary dynamic. It also plays a critical role
in ecology, supporting ecosystem engineering and influencing the
flow of energy and nutrients through ecosystems. Despite this,
niche construction has been given short shrift in theoretical
biology, in part because it cannot be fully understood within the
framework of standard evolutionary theory.Wedding evolution and ecology, this book extends evolutionary
theory by formally including niche construction and ecological
inheritance as additional evolutionary processes. The authors
support their historic move with empirical data, theoretical
population genetics, and conceptual models. They also describe new
research methods capable of testing the theory. They demonstrate
how their theory can resolve long-standing problems in ecology,
particularly by advancing the sorely needed synthesis of ecology
and evolution, and how it offers an evolutionary basis for the
human sciences.Already hailed as a pioneering work by some of the world's most
influential biologists, this is a rare, potentially field-changing

However, evolution has often been conceptualised as a simple process: short-term directional adaptation that increases population growth. Here we argue that diverse other evolutionary processes, well studied in population genetics and evolutionary ecology, should also be considered to explore the full spectrum of feedback between ecological and evolutionary processes. Relevant but underappreciated processes include (1) drift and mutation, (2) disruptive selection causing lineage diversification or speciation reversal and (3) evolution driven by relative fitness differences that may decrease population growth.

Two main theoretical frameworks are used to address this question, adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics, both of which have strengths and limitations and are often used by distinct research communities to address different questions. In order to make progress, new theoretical developments are needed that integrate these approaches and strengthen the link to empirical data. Here, we discuss a novel theoretical framework that bridges the gap between quantitative genetics and adaptive dynamics approaches. ‘Oligomorphic dynamics’ can be used to analyse eco-evolutionary dynamics across different time scales and extends quantitative genetics theory to account for multimodal trait distributions, the dynamical nature of genetic variance, the potential for disruptive selection due to ecological feedbacks, and the non-normal or skewed trait distributions encountered in nature. Oligomorphic dynamics explicitly takes into account the effect of environmental feedback, such as frequency- and density-dependent selection, on the dynamics of multi-modal trait distributions and we argue it has the potential to facilitate a much tighter integration between eco-evolutionary theory and empirical data.},

   abstract = {For many organisms, stage is a better predictor of demographic rates than age. Yet no general theoretical framework exists for understanding or predicting evolution in stage-structured populations. Here, we provide a general modeling approach that can be used to predict evolution and demography of stage-structured populations. This advances our ability to understand evolution in stagestructured populations to a level previously available only for populations structured by age. We use this framework to provide the first rigorous proof that Lande's theorem, which relates adaptive evolution to population growth, applies to stage-classified populations, assuming only normality and that evolution is slow relative to population dynamics. We extend this theorem to allow for different means or variances among stages. Our next major result is the formulation of Price's theorem, a fundamental law of evolution, for stage-structured populations. In addition, we use data from Trillium grandiflorum to demonstrate how our models can be applied to a real-world population and thereby show their practical potential to generate accurate projections of evolutionary and population dynamics. Finally, we use our framework to compare rates of evolution in age- versus stage-structured populations, which shows how our methods can yield biological insights about evolution in stage-structured populations. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

   abstract = {Time series of rapid phenotypic change have been documented in age-structured populations living in the wild. Researchers are often interested in identifying the processes responsible for such change. We derive an equation to exactly decompose change in the mean value of a phenotypic trait into contributions from fluctuations in the demographic structure and age-specific viability selection, fertility selection, phenotypic plasticity, and differences between offspring and parental trait values. We treat fitness as a sum of its components rather than as a scalar and explicitly consider age structure by focusing on short time steps, which are appropriate for describing phenotypic change in species with overlapping generations. We apply the method to examine stasis in birth weight in a well-characterized population of red deer. Stasis is achieved because positive viability selection for an increase in birth weight is countered by parents producing offspring that are, on average, smaller than they were at birth. This is one of many ways in which equilibria in the mean value of a phenotypic trait can be maintained. The age-structured Price equation we derive has the potential to provide considerable insight into the processes generating now frequently reported cases of rapid phenotypic change. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.},
